<h2>The moving finger</h2>
<p> <h3> "The moving finger" is a detective story written by Agatha Christie. Agatha Christie was a famous writer in the 20th century. <br> <br> Jerry Burton - a pilot who got into an accident and now is an invalid. <br> Joanna Burton - Mr. Burtons younger sister, said to be attractive. She likes dancing, cocktails and love affairs. <br> Megan Symmington - very clumsy, young girl not too pretty. Daughter of Mrs Symmington and her precious husband. Not very liked by the villagers. <br> <br> Mr Burton and his sister move to Lymstock so that he can compleatly heal after the accident. After a week they get an anonymous letter saying horrible things. And so these letters are coming to every person who lives in Lymstock till one is driven to despair and the first death has come. But it doesn't stop there. To find out who is the killer, read the story yourself. <br> <br> I recommend this book to those who like detective stories and mystery. I don't recommend this book to small children because it may be a bit hard to follow. I personally liked this book. It wasvery interesting, you could think along the storyline and make your own assumptions. <h3></p>

<h2>The body in the library </h2>
<p> <h3> I read “The body in the library”, it’s a detective and mystery story written by Agatha Christie. <br><br>
  One morning at Gossington Hall the  maid wakes up the house owners named Arthur Bantry and Dolly Bantry to inform them about the <br> terrifying news – a dead body has been found in their library. Dolly Bantry knows that there’s only one person to call, old Miss Marple.

  As the investigation goes on turns out that Conway Jefferson wanted to adopt <br> Ruby and was already getting the papers ready. Conway Jefferson was already old and not so healthy anymore, after his death he wanted to leave all <br> his money to Ruby.
  A few days later another dead young girl was found. <br> <br> Will the investigators find a way to connect the deaths? Will they figure out who’s the murderer before they kill another person?
